## Modules

1. Unit Convertion
2. Steam Table (based on IAPWS)
3. Restriction Orifice Calculation

### 1. Unit Convertion

The unti convertion is based on [Unit Convert](https://github.com/jocelynlopez/unit_converter).

### 2. Steam Table

### 3. Restriction Orifice Calculation

### 4. Control Valve Sizing

$$ C_V = Q \sqrt{\frac{SG}{\Delta P}}$$

where:

$`Q`$ is volumetric flow rate in SCFH, standard cubic feet per hour,

$`SG`$ is fluid specific gravity at standard conditions (water = 1.0)

$`\Delta P`$ is the differential pressure across the valve in PSI

$`\Delta P = P_1 - P_2`$
